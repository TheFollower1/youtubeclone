  <br>This project was made possible with SuperSimpleDev
  <br>Many thanks to the complete course of HTML & CSS full course
  <br>A quick note for personal reference this guide was followed
      after completing the Foundations Project: Landing Page @The
      Odin Project. I wanted to learn the full power of CSS before I moved on with the project to Javascript.
